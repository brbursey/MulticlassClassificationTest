# MulticlassClassificationTest
Learning how to create a Classification model using ML.NET.

# What is it?
This is a model that can predict an input's value based on its features when it can be of more than two types.

# How to use
To predict your own datasets, you will need to write up a few classes just like the Iris data classes are setup. 
Further documentation will be provided once I have finished refactoring.
